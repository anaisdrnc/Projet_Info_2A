## 3. How to use our application ? 

### 3.1 Install required packages 

In Git Bash, run the following commands to:
- install all packages from file requirements.txt
- list all packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip list
```

### 3.2 Environnement Variables

At the root of the project :
- Create a file called .env
- Paste in and complete the elements below

```
POSTGRES_HOST = postgresql-497164.user-id****
POSTGRES_PORT = 5432
POSTGRES_DATABASE = defaultdb
POSTGRES_USER = user-id****
POSTGRES_PASSWORD = ******
POSTGRES_SCHEMA = default_schema
POSTGRES_SCHEMA_TEST = test
JWT_SECRET = ****

```

### 3.3 Units tests 
- In Git Bash: pytest -v
- or python -m pytest -v if pytest has not been added to PATH

> **Tests Units DAO**
To ensure tests are repeatable, safe, and do not interfere with the real database, we use a dedicated schema for unit testing.

The DAO unit tests use data from the data/db_test.sql file.

This data is loaded into a separate schema (test) so as not to pollute the other data.

### 3.4 Launch the CLI application

This application provides a very basic graphical interface for navigating between different menus.

In Git Bash : python src/main_CLI.py

### 3.4 Launch the API application 


In Git Bash : python src/__main__.py
